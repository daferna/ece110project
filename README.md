#ECE110 Lab Final Project

The final design project for the ECE 110 lab involves programming a small car to do line following around a track. You can read more about it [here](http://courses.engr.illinois.edu/ece110/Lab/).

*	The ece110 folder contains an Arduino sketch used for running the robot.
*	The eeprom\_write\_calibrate folder contains an Arduino sketched used for writing calibration values for the IR sensors to the EEPROM.
*	The report.tex can be compiled yourself, or you can read the ready-made report.pdf output.
