\section{Introduction}
The final design project involves programming a small car to follow a white line around a track.

\section{Design Philosophy}
Our design process started with the choice to use the Arduino microcontroller, rather than TTL logic. Using a microprocessor allows the design to use the same IR sensors for triggering different reactions. Many TTL logic designs have IR sensors dedicated to one task---such as split detection or stop detection. A microprocessor can address each IR sensor individually and use the same sensors for split detection and stop detection.
